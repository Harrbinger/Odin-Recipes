    <H3>Taking only 25 minutes to make and producing 6 servings, this is a fantastic meal to make if you are low on time, but need something very filling. Most, if not all, of the ingredients can be found in almost any kitchen, making it even easier to whip up if you're in a rush! Mac and Cheese is a widely loved food which makes it a great option for any number of occasions.</H3>

    <H2 class="list-title">Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup real bacon bits</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ul>

    <H2 class="list-title">Directions</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> <strong>Chef's Note:</strong>You can use butter in place of margarine, if you prefer.</p>
